\section{Abstract}
	We propose a new paradigm to easily get a portable geometric Level Of Details (LOD) inside a Point Cloud Server.
	The point cloud is divided into groups (patches) which are reordered so that reading patches points following this order gradually provides more and more details on the patch.
	\todoall{cette phrase est un peu longue, faire plus simple}
	Using a LOD has multiple applications: visualisation of massive point cloud, algorithm acceleration,
	 fast density peak detection and correction.
	Our method also embeds information about the sensed object geometric nature that can be used as a crude multi-scale dimensionality descriptor,
	enabling fast classification for basic classes and on-the-fly filtering.
