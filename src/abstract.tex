\section{Abstract}
	We introduce a new ordering for point cloud based on octree, which allows, after a pre-computing phase, to effortlessly get a portable representative geometric Level Of Details (LOD). This LOD have then multiple applications: point cloud size reduction for  visualisation (point cloud streaming) or speeding of slow algorithm, fast density peak detection and correction as well as safeguard for methods that may be sensible to density variations. The LOD method is also used as a crude dimensionality descriptor, enabling fast classification and on-the-fly filtering with simple classes.
